			Welcome to greed

This game is now maintained by Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>.  Matt
Day dropped out of sight and hasn't posted a new version or patch since 1990.
You can surf to the latest version from

	http://www.catb.org/~esr/

The 3.1 version features better interrupt handling and the `p' suffix to
GREEDOPTS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Greed v3.0a!
To install Greed, simply edit the Makefile to configure your system type, and
run "make install".  It should compile the program and install it correctly.
It does run set-uid, but there is no danger of security problems.

New features to v3.0a:

I certainly hope that no patches need to be made to this game. (Yeah, sure..)
Although this might not validate a true version step from 2.1a to 3.0, I think
the archives will be happier with a reset version.  On with the new features..

With Microsoft C 5.1 and PCCurses, you can get Greed running on your PC.
In fact, I'll bet a port to Turbo C 2.0 wouldn't be very hard at all, but I
use Microsoft.  The whole port was done by Fred C. Smith, more info on him
can be found at the top of greed.c.  All bug reports pertaining to the DOS
port should be directed to the address of Fred specified in greed.c.

Additions to v3.0a (game-wise):
Replaced '-p' option with 'p' command, to allow toggling of the highlighting
moves feature.  Pretty nice, I think.. thanks to Jim Prescott.

Color curses, for users with color capabilities (color monitor & SVR3).
See the top of greed.c for details.

Couple of possible pointer problems fixed, thanks to David Connet for pointing
them out.

Who knows what else.. I didn't bother to write them down, but more than just
this did get done.  Trust me!

I do not take credit for inventing the game, I once saw it on an IBM,
and wrote it for Unix in C.
