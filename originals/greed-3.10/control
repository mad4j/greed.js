Package: greed

Description: Eat as much as you can before munching yourself into a corner!
 When you move in a direction, you erase N grid squares in that direction, 
 N being the first number in that direction and your score for the move.
 You cannot move onto a space you have already eaten, and the game ends 
 when you cannot move.
